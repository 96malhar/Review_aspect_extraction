Super simple place but amazing nonetheless. 
It's been around since the 30's and they still serve the same thing they started with: a bologna and salami sandwich with mustard. 

Staff was very helpful and friendly.
Small unassuming place that changes their menu every so often. 
Cool decor and vibe inside their 30 seat restaurant. 
Call for a reservation. 

We had their beef tartar and pork belly to start and a salmon dish and lamb meal for mains. 
Everything was incredible! 
I could go on at length about how all the listed ingredients really make their dishes amazing but honestly you just need to go.
